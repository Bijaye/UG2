Our systems does not check for the proper use of "a" and "an", thus allowing both "a duck" and "an duck".(This would be a feature of a context-sensitive language) One way to solve this would be to add an extra step in the type checking and describe this additional rule: we could use parameterized types and for every verb get whether it starts with a vowel or not(as a basic rule, not including exceptions), similarly to how we checked for number agreement. Alternatively, we can just store the determiner given as a statement and check if the same is used in the question.
Another thing that might be confusing is that the grammar for statements does not store more that a property at a time (so we have to write both "John is a duck" and "John is purple", whereas we can ask "Who is a purple duck?")
