Our systems does not check for the proper use of "a" and "an", thus allowing both "a duck" and "an duck". One way to solve this would be to use parameterized types and for every verb check whether it starts with a vowel or not(and exceptions), similarly to how we checked for number agreement.
Another thing that might be confusing is that the grammar for statements does not store more that a property at a time (so we have to write both "John is a duck" and "John is purple", whereas we can ask "Who is a purple duck?")
